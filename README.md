# Zillow Web Scrapper
New home sales and housing prices are on the rise. Our goal in this project is to understand the factors that impact housing prices and to predict the price of a house with given features. These predictions have implications on the ability of home buyers and sellers to accurately negotiate the value of any given housing property.

Zillow keeps record of property listings in Madison, WI online at https://www.zillow.com/madison-wi. The data readily accessible for scraping included the property
